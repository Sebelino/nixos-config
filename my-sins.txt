# Sin: Fn-lock not configured to be on by default
When I got a new Thinkpad, the way to e.g. increase volume was to press F3,
rather than Fn+F3. I.e. the Fn keys were "inverted". I found that this was
because "FnLock" was not on. To enable it, I needed to look for a key labeled
FnLock on my keyboard -- Esc in my case -- and press Fn+Esc. I wonder if this
default behavior is configurable in Nix.
